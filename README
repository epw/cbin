This repository serves one main purpose: I have built up hundreds of
scripts and programs over the years, and always copy the ~/bin
directory from my most up-to-date computer when starting a new
one. Instead, they can now be kept synchronized.

For any public users who have found this, I hope some of the scripts
are useful, but do note that they are a reflection of ten years of
learning Linux, and so many make sense to me and no-one else, may do
what you consider damage to your computer, and otherwise are very
strange. Use at your own risk. Someday, I may document more of
them. Note that this also includes a number of variable definitions,
aliases, and a few functions for the shell.

To install, add these lines to your .bashrc or similar file (assuming
cbin is in your home directory)

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cbin
source $HOME/cbin/.cbashrc

Or, from within cbin, run the program
    $ ./install-cbin.sh
Which will do the same thing. It takes one optional argument, the name
of the file to write to if not $HOME/.bashrc
