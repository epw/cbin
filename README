This repository serves one main purpose: I have built up hundreds of
scripts and programs over the years, and always copy the ~/bin
directory from my most up-to-date computer when starting a new
one. Instead, they can now be kept synchronized.

To install, add this line to your .bashrc or similar file:
PATH=$PATH:/path/where/you/downloaded/cbin

Or, from within cbin, run the program
    $ ./install-cbin.sh
Which will do the same thing. It takes one optional argument, the name
of the file to write to if not $HOME/.bashrc
